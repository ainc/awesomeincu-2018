So, you've got the basics down. You've taken a class or two, followed some tutorials, built a few “Hello, world” programs. How do you go beyond learning-to-code and take your software development skills to the next level? The Awesome Inc Academy is our answer.

The Academy is our premier training program for students age 13 - 17 who aspire to be software developers. This program runs for 14 weeks each Spring and Fall semester, and meets twice a week, two hours per night.

During program sessions, our team of coding coaches work with each student to select a challenging final project, assess his or her current skill level, then design a curriculum to help them achieve their goals. Students work alongside other highly-talented peers to gain exposure to a breadth of topics, not just their own focus area. In addition to 56 in-class hours, our coaches are available throughout the semester via Slack online chat.

## Academy Outcomes:

*   Make your own Apps, Games, and Websites
*   Learn Software Development methodology, communication skills, and teamwork
*   Meet professional programmers from local tech companies
