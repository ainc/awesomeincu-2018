Learning to code can be intimidating on your own. Maybe you’ve started an online course, but never finished. Perhaps you’ve made a website with Wordpress or a drag-and-drop web design tool, but want to do more. If you’re curious if a career in code is for you, or just want to gain a useful new skill, Awesome Inc’s **{{page.title}}** is made for people like you.

This part-time, evening course covers the same introductory topics used to prepare students for our full-time, intensive Bootcamp program. It is designed to help you build a solid foundation in front-end web development using technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This course is designed for adult learners who are interested in web development. It's a great place to start if you work with developers and want to learn to speak their language, or if you're considering our immersive Bootcamp program but want to try code before making a full-time commitment (see Tuition Credit below). Prior Awesome Inc students have come from a variety of backgrounds, including manufacturing, law, retail, design, food service, and healthcare.

Classes are two nights per week, two hours per night, for nine weeks. In addition to in-class hours, our instructional team is available remotely for Q&A throughout the week via Slack.

## Curriculum

6. More JavaScript (arrays, objects, functions)
